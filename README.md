<h2>Structured memory</h2>

A game, much like the child hood game that tests your concentration, app that uses tweets as data.

Tweet. Cocentrate. Remember.

<h2>Usage</h2>
In the inner memory dirctory, load memory.html within a browser. Like so: file:///yourpathtomemorydirectory/memory/memory.html

<h2>Known Issues:</h2>
Jsonp doesn't handle error callbacks. Therefore, twitter usernames that are either private or don't exist fail silently. Workarounds are in progress and are welcomed.
